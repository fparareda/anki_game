# Anki

Anki is a spaced repetition flashcard program. Anki (暗記) is the Japanese word for memorization.

A student is proposed a **Deck** of cards, one face of the **card** contains a **question**, the other face the **answer**.
The **student** **studies** the question, tries to guess the answer and then looks if the answer he guessed was correct.

- If the student did not know the answer of the Card, he places the card in a **red box**
- If he did know a part of the answer of the Card, he places the card in a **orange box**
- If he did know the answer of the Card, he places the card in a **green box**

When all the card has been seen, the **session** is over : 

- The cards in the red box will be studied again the same day
- The cards in the orange box will be studied again the next
- The cards in the green box, will be studied again two days later
